# üöß Technical Hurdles, Design Considerations & Future Work

This document outlines the key challenges faced during the development of the GAN-based Medical Image Generator, the solutions implemented, and areas identified for future improvement.

---

## 1. üß¨ Data Complexity and Diversity

- **Challenge:**  
  High variation across modalities (MRI, CT, MMG, etc.), anatomy types, and image resolutions make it hard to generalize models.

- **Solution:**  
  Modular integration of multiple pretrained models (via `medigan`); standardized input/output processing and consistent metadata handling.

---

## 2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Training Stability in GANs

- **Challenge:**  
  GANs are inherently unstable ‚Äî prone to mode collapse, vanishing gradients, and convergence failure.

- **Solution:**  
  Use pretrained and validated models (e.g., DCGAN, ProGAN). Incorporate models trained on public datasets with robust architectures.

---

## 3. üéØ Evaluation of Synthetic Image Quality

- **Challenge:**  
  Metrics like PSNR or FID may not fully capture the clinical value or realism of generated medical images.

- **Solution:**  
  Combine quantitative metrics with qualitative expert reviews, and where applicable, validate images via downstream classification or segmentation performance.

---

## 4. üß† Integration of Pretrained Models (Medigan)

- **Challenge:**  
  Inconsistent configuration schema, complex metadata, and loading issues when using third-party pretrained models.

- **Solution:**  
  Abstracted model metadata and inference logic in `helpers.py`. Parsed configs via `get_config_by_id()` to extract clean `description`, `modality`, `organ`.

---

## 5. üß™ Dynamic Model Metadata Display

- **Challenge:**  
  Streamlit‚Äôs reactive state system caused stale model metadata when the user switched models too quickly.

- **Solution:**  
  Managed state via `st.session_state` and triggered forced refresh (`st.rerun()`) when model selection changed. Cached metadata using `st.cache_data()` for performance.

---

## 6. üñºÔ∏è Grid Layout Rendering

- **Challenge:**  
  Default Streamlit rendering displayed all generated images in one row, regardless of grid layout value.

- **Solution:**  
  Created dynamic layout with `st.columns()` based on user-defined grid size. Capped image generation at 16 for memory and usability control.

---

## 7. üíª Computational Resource Constraints

- **Challenge:**  
  GAN inference (and especially training) is compute-heavy, often requiring GPU acceleration.

- **Solution:**  
  Offloaded training entirely. Focused on lightweight inference using small sample sizes and cached models. Streamlit UI supports CPU usage for demo purposes.

---

## 8. üßæ User Experience and Interface

- **Challenge:**  
  Users need to select models, control layout, understand metadata, and download outputs ‚Äî all intuitively.

- **Solution:**  
  Minimalist UI with:
  - Controlled dropdowns/sliders
  - Rich metadata display using `st.expander()`
  - Download as `.zip`
  - Help tooltips for image count and layout settings

---

## 9. üîê Ethical and Regulatory Considerations

- **Challenge:**  
  Generated synthetic images should not be misconstrued as clinically validated data.

- **Solution:**  
  Added persistent warnings and disclaimers. Models and images are for **educational and research use only**.
